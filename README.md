To whom it may concern - I pull these assignments from the class gitlab - and then work on them locally but I cant seem to push select files to my own github - this results in all my commits being wiped as github thinks im only adding files manually -- I just want to show proof that I am commiting as I progress with sections of the assignment. The next assignment, I will work on creating a repository first and then work from that so that all my commits show.
